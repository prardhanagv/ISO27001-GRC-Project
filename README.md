# ISO 27001 GRC Projects – Gap Analysis & Vendor Risk Management

## Overview
This repository contains two practical Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) projects aligned with ISO 27001 concepts. The projects demonstrate hands-on understanding of information security governance, risk assessment, and third-party risk management.
