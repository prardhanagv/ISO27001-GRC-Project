**Gap Analysis & Risk Assessment Automation**

This project demonstrates understanding of ISO 27001 and GRC (Governance, Risk, Compliance) concepts.

- Performed a **Gap Analysis** to identify missing or partially implemented ISO 27001 controls.
- Created a **Risk Register** documenting assets, threats, vulnerabilities, and controls.
- Automated **Risk Level calculations** using Python in Google Colab.
- Generated a **summary of High, Medium, and Low risks** to prioritize mitigation efforts.

**Files included:**
- `Gap_Analysis.pdf` → ISO 27001 control gaps
- `Risk_Register.xlsx` → Cleaned Risk Register with Risk Levels
- `Risk_Assessment_Automation.ipynb` → Python notebook for automation

**Skills demonstrated:** ISO 27001 basics, Risk assessment, Python automation, Data cleaning, Reporting
